If you'd like to have original soundtrack in game go to http://www.youtube-mp3.org/ (or similar) and use link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCCQxVBfyM

Downloaded mp3 ought to be renamed to tetris.mp3 and placed in music folder. ACTA is coming and I'm not going to risk sharing any copyrighted content :)

To play the game use http://fridek.github.com/Threejs-Tetris/

Tutorial based on the game http://www.smashinglabs.pl/three-js-tetris-tutorial
