"The Claw" is one of the three projects I built for my Introduct to Computer Graphics course at Northwestern University in 2014. I chose to challenge myself by putting the concepts I learned in WebGL, 3D shapes, and 3D transforms into recreating the popular claw arcade game. While demoing the code for the robot arm in class, I thought it would be fun to take that concept and imitate it in the claw game. Then I added other minor but detailed elements, such as the on-screen messages and the “toys”, to turn this project into a real game. 

Interacting with this game is straight forward. When the game is launched in a maximized window in Google Chrome, game instructions are displayed on the screen. Then, when the user begins playing, the instructions are available on the left side of the screen as a quick reference. 

Basically, the user has 3 ways to play the game: by using the keyboard, the on-screen buttons, or their mouse. First, if the user plays with their keyboard, they can use only the left and right arrow buttons to control the left and right movement of the claw and the spacebar to drop the claw. If the user plays with the on-screen buttons, they can use the left and right buttons to control the movement of the claw and the circular button to drop the claw. Finally, if the user plays with their mouse, they can click on the claw and drag it left and right to control the movement of the claw. However, once they let go of the mouse, the claw will begin to drop. With the mouse movement, the user is constrained to the WebGL canvas, so they won’t be able to control the claw anywhere else on the screen. 


## Results

_First on-screen message that displays game instructions._

_“buggy” claw movement; claw still swings left and right even while dropping; also it doesn’t retract smoothly to the starting position._

_In honor of the real claw games that can’t be won, my game also can’t be won so this is the end of the game message that is displayed after the claw is dropped and brought back up._
